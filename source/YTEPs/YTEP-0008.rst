YTEP-0008: Release Schedule
===========================

Abstract
--------

Created: February 21, 2013
Author: Matthew Turk

The yt release schedule is somewhat dysfunctional in several ways.  Release
dates can be difficult to stick to, and merges to stable occur only after long
periods.  This results in bug fixes not propagating and increases the pressure
on developers for a given "release," as each release is seen as monumental
rather than incremental.  This YTEP describes a new mechanism for increasing
the cadence of point releases as well as merging from the development branch
into the stable branch.

Detailed Description
--------------------

The yt release schedule is irregular.  Here's a table of the releases over
time, along with the number of days since the most recent major (i.e.,
non-point) release. Depending on when this document was last updated, this
may include both planned and historical releases.

======= ============ ===============

In principle, a long release schedule is not a problem.  However, what this
results in is a reluctance to merge to the stable branch.  This has two major
side effects: it leads to many people working off of the development branch and
it leads to a long time between bug fixes for individuals working off of the
stable branch.  The development branch, despite its name, is quite stable --
however, this also means that when instabilities (or API changes) are
introduced in the development branch, it can be much more disruptive.

What Constitutes a Release
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The majority of development in the primary yt repository is stable.  Seldom are
backwards-incompatible changes introduced, nor functionality broken.  This is
helped by continuous integration and detailed code review.  As such, for the
most part, yt is in a constant state of "release."

For the purposes of this document, a "release" constitutes five things:

  * A new build of the documentation with API and cookbook is placed in a
    long-term container.
  * The development branch (``yt``) is merged to the stable branch (``stable``)
  * A new tag in the version control history
  * An upload of the source code to PyPI ( http://pypi.python.org/ )
  * An announcement email (to ``yt-users`` for minor releases and more broadly
    for major releases)
  * For "bugfix"-level releases, changes should be backported to the ``stable``
    branch using the ``pr_backport.py`` script.

Long Term Support Branch
++++++++++++++++++++++++

As development on underlying infrastructure of yt continues apace, we must
provide long-term support for the existing infrastructure.  As such, we will
continue to provide (time, effort and need permitting) the existing 2.X
branches with critical bugfixes.

Here is an outline of the release dates for the remainder of 2014.  This YTEP
will be updated as time goes on with additional release dates for long-term
stability, but currently it is anticipated that this release schedule will
relax over time once the next-generation branch (described below) becomes
viable.

This branch will be known as ``yt-2.x``.

Release Managers
++++++++++++++++

The release manager for minor releases will be Matthew Turk, as they will only
be announced to ``yt-users``.  For major releases, a new release manager will
be selected by consensus in the ``yt-dev`` community.  Merging, tagging and
uploading will be handled by Matthew Turk, but the release manager will act as
"whip" to ensure the necessary documentation building is done.  Additionally,
this release manager will write the release notes and send the email to various
mailing lists.

Backwards Compatibility
-----------------------

This should have no backwards-incompatible changes.

Alternatives
------------

One alternative would be to forego release numbers and move to completely
continuous integration.  Another would be to continue on our current path.
