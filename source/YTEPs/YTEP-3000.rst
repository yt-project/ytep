YTEP-3000: Let's all start using yt 3.0!
========================================

Abstract

Created: October 30, 2013
Author: Matthew Turk

This is a YTEP suggesting we all start using yt 3.0 for development, and where
the blockers to adoption are enumerated.

Project Management Links
------------------------

Basically all the project management links up to this point have been talking
about this.

Detailed Description
--------------------

This YTEP outlines the items necessary to be implemented before yt 3.0 can be
released, and before we can attempt to move development and day-to-day usage
for developers to the 3.0 codebase.

There are essentially three categories of work items: release blockers,
necessary features to migrate usage and development, and feature parity
requirements.

Several developers have expressed that a major blocker is concluding work they
have begun on yt 2.6 and the 2.x branch; this document is meant to supplement
that, rather than replace it.

Release Blockers
++++++++++++++++

These are components that need implementing before yt 3.0 can be released.
This is not the same as reaching a "complete" implementation; the important
work is to ensure that subsequent API breakages are minimal.  We are tracking
these on the `yt-3.0 Trello Board <https://trello.com/b/Y5XV4Hod/yt-3-0>`__.

 * Merging unitrefactor; waiting only on documentation and rebranding merge at
   this time. (:ref:`YTEP-0011 <ytep-0011>` and :ref:`YTEP-0017 <ytep-0017>`.)
 * De-astroification of yt and renaming of generic objects which has been
   mostly accomplished in the rebranding bookmark.
 * Removing dict-like access to static output (:ref:`YTEP-0018 <ytep-0018>`),
   not yet compelted in the rebranding bookmark.
 * Considerable amount of documentation, which is being worked on.

I do not believe there are any other blockers to yt 3.0.

Necessary Features
++++++++++++++++++

These are items that are necessary for developers to migrate from using and
developing yt 2.6 to yt 3.0.

This is intentionally left mostly empty, as items from "feature parity" will be
migrated up.

 * ``field_cuts`` (which is a related to ``cut_region``, which has been mostly
   implemented.)

Feature Parity
++++++++++++++

These are items that existed in yt 2.6 that do not exist in yt 3.0 yet.

 * A handful of hierarchy attributes have not yet been implemented.
 * A few frontends still need polishing during the port, including Chombo,
   Pluto, NMSU-ART, and GDF.  These are small items but will need assistance
   from individual frontend maintainers.
 * The sidecar storage has not been ported.
 * Boolean regions have not been implemented.  They can likely be implemented
   in the same manner as ``cut_region`` has been.

Backwards Compatibility
-----------------------

This does not add any new backwards incompatible items, it is merely a call to
action.
