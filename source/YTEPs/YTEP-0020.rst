Detailed Description
--------------------

The ``PlotCollection`` object was designed to work with the package HippoDraw,
as a means of controlling multiple plots from a single command.  This was also
focused very strongly on the idea of viewing a single object from multiple
angles, and was mostly useful for my research.  All other uses largely used it
as the only mechanism of creating plots -- not because of any particular
functionality it has.

With yt 3.0, I propose that we remove the ``PlotCollection`` entirely, as its
functionality is 100% replaced by the various other objects such as
``SlicePlot``, ``ProjectionPlot``, ``ProfilePlot`` and ``PhasePlot``, all of
which are more modern and provide greater access to the underlying matplotlib
objects.

This change will occur in yt 3.0.  Nearly all users have migrated to using
``SlicePlot`` and so on, and we are seeing much greater uptake of
``ProfilePlot`` and ``PhasePlot``.  Because we also anticipate growing our
community with this release, and because it will be the time when we can break
backwards compatibility, this is the most natural time to remove it.

Backwards Compatibility
-----------------------

Existing scripts that utilize ``PlotCollection`` will break, but there will be
other yt-3.0 changes that they may suffer from anyway.

Alternatives
------------

I do not think we have the resources to pursue alternate options such as
supporting ``PlotCollection`` in perpetuity.
