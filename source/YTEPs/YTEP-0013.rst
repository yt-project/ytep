YTEP-0013: Deposited Particle Fields
====================================

Abstract
--------
Created: April 25, 2013

Author: Chris Moody, Matthew Turk, Britton Smith, Doug Rudd, Sam Leitner

The majority of the yt codebase is currently built around Eulerian, grid 
or cell-like quantities. In order to use particle quantities, we typically
have to deposit particles and essentially make them look like fluid quantities.
This YTEP details the suggest deposition process, how to implement it,
how to extend and subclass it, and suggested syntax.

This should improve particle support for Octrees and SPH codes dramatically,
and extend particle deposition syntax for grid-patch codes.

Note that while this covers initial implementation of particle deposition, that
deposition does *not* include smoothing kernels that utilize extended regions
outside of the target region.  SPH smoothing kernel implementations will be
defiend in a subsequent YTEP.

Status
------

Accepted: an implementation has been written, tested and included.

Detailed Description
--------------------

Particle Deposition in yt 2.x
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Currently, particle deposition for grid-patch codes works by 
querying particle fields and supplying them to a routine like 
CIC_Deposit3. It is non-trivial to extend this CIC function 
to octree codes but essential to making SPH codes interoperable
with the yt codebase.


Proposed Syntax
+++++++++++++++

The names of deposited fields can be user-defined, and thus are not explicitly
restricted. However, as having a deposited fields becomes more common in the yt
framework and libraries begin to expect and depend on particular names, 
we do suggest that field names are prefixed with ``deposit_``. This 
indicates that the returned array is shaped like a fluid field and not
particle-shaped.  This is distinct from ``gas`` as we may have conflicting or
overlapping field definitions.

Example Deposited Field
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Below is example particle deposition field defined in Python::

    @derived_field(name = "deposit_particle_count",
                   validators=[ValidateSpatial()])
    def particle_count(field, data):
        pos = np.column_stack([data["particle_position_%s" % ax]
                               for ax in 'xyz'])
        return data.deposit(pos, method = "count")

Changes to Frontend Code
++++++++++++++++++++++++

We exploit the fact that the octree frontends share a common
base class ``OctreeSubset(YTSelectionContainer)`` to create a common
function ``deposit()``. The patch-based codes have an analogous 
``AMRGridPatch(YTSelectionContainer)``. The deposition is passed
the particle positions, the particle fields required, and the
deposition method: ``deposit(positions, field = None, method = None)``.
The deposit function uses ``method`` to lookup a Cython 
``ParticleDepositOperation`` class in ``particle_deposit.pyx``. This class
defines the deposition procedure in three steps, which ``deposit`` calls 
sequentially. The first ``ParticleDepositOperation`` member function 
is ``initialize`` which allocates the memory
required to hold temporary arrays for the deposition of particles into
grids or octs. Extra temporary arrays are useful when a reduction of data
must occur after the we have looped through all particles. The next step
is either ``process_octree`` or ``process_grid`` where we loop over all
particles, find the oct or cell in an octree or grid (respectively). Once
found, we call ``process(dims, left_edge, dds, 0, pos, field_vals)`` which
relates a single particle, its associated cell, and the incremental deposited
value. The last step ``finalize`` reduces the data from the temporary arrays
and return an oct-shaped or grid-shaped array. 
This organization allows us to seperate the particle lookup along in a
grid or oct tree from the deposition operation we would like to perform. 

Example Cython Code
+++++++++++++++++++

Below we include an example of the base particle deposit class with 
most of the Cython type definitions removed for legibility::

    cdef class ParticleDepositOperation:
        def initialize(self, *args): raise NotImplementedError
        def finalize(self, *args): raise NotImplementedError
        def process_octree(self, octree, dom_ind, positions, fields = None):
            for i in range(positions.shape[0]):
                oct = octree.get(pos, &oi)
                offset = dom_ind[oct.ind]
                self.process(dims, oi.left_edge, oi.dds,
                             offset, pos, field_vals)
        def process_grid(self, gobj, positions,fields = None):
            for i in range(positions.shape[0]):
                for j in range(3):
                    pos[j] = positions[i, j]
                self.process(dims, left_edge, dds, 0, pos, field_vals)
        def process(self, *args): raise NotImplementedError

Below we subclass the template above to deposit a particle count,
taking care to override ``initialize``, ``process`` and ``finalize``
but leaving grid traversal in ``process_octree/grid`` alone, ensuring
that this will work with grid and octree codes::

    cdef class CountParticles(ParticleDepositOperation):
        def initialize(self):
            self.ocount = np.zeros(self.nvals, dtype="float64")
            cdef np.ndarray arr = self.ocount
            self.count = <np.float64_t*> arr.data
        @cython.cdivision(True)
        cdef void process(self, int dim[3],left_edge[3], dds[3], offset, 
                          ppos[3], *fields):
            cdef int ii[3], i
            for i in range(3):
                ii[i] = <int>((ppos[i] - left_edge[i])/dds[i])
            self.count[gind(ii[0], ii[1], ii[2], dim) + offset] += 1
        def finalize(self):
            return self.ocount

Using the templates and organizational scheme proposed here, one can
define fields with arbitrary particle selections (e.g. young stars),
perform arbitrary accumulations (e.g. count, sum, or std),
loops over all of the particles multiple times, and switch between
cloud-in-cell, SPH smoothing kernel, or simple direct deposition.

Future SPH Kernel
+++++++++++++++++

This process will be utilized in the future to conduct smoothing kernel
operations.  This will require two operations:

 * Iteration over the Octs, rather than the particles, and selection of
   particles based on proximity to an Oct
 * An octree selector that has lee-way in its selection of particles; i.e.,
   particles can be fed in as having a ``dx`` that allows them to be selected
   by octs within which they do not directly reside.

We may find that this specific operation is too slow for applying the smoothing
kernel, in which case other options will be explored.

This has no backwards incompatible changes.
